## 🧩 How It Works

1. The program asks:
   - How many questions you want to answer.
   - The difficulty level.
   - The type of math operation.

2. Then it randomly generates questions based on your choices.

3. For each question:
   - You input your answer.
   - The program checks if it’s correct.
   - Your score is updated in real time.

4. At the end:
   - The final result is displayed (Pass or Fail).
   - You can choose to play again.
